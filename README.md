# 30 Days of AI Engineering

# 🚀 Zero to AI Engineer in 30 Days
**Author:** Najmal Ibrahim
**Focus:** LLMs, RAG, and Multilingual AI Agents (Hindi/English).
**Goal:** Building production-grade AI systems with limited hardware (RTX 1080) by optimizing for efficiency.

This repository documents my intensive journey from beginner to AI Engineer, following a roadmap tailored for LLMs, RAG, and Multilingual Agents.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

### Vector Embeddings
Converting words into lists of numbers (coordinates) so machines can understand their meaning. 
*Example:* `King` and `Man` have similar vector directions, while `King` and `Apple` are far apart.

### The Dot Product
A mathematical calculation to measure similarity between two vectors.
- High Score = High Similarity (e.g., Question & Answer).
- Low Score = No Relation.
- *Application:* This is the core engine behind RAG (Chat with PDF).
- [ ] Day 3: API Integration

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** PyTorch, LangChain, Hugging Face
- **Hardware:** Local RTX 1080 + Cloud Compute
